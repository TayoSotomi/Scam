 <p>Business owners and entrepreneurs are well positioned to build their wealth and get rich, however we’re not talking about a how to get rich quick scheme. Most self-made millionaires have built their wealth through their business.
 When you own a business, you can control the amount of wealth that you want to create for yourself. You can tailor your business to your revenue and profit goals.

 Smart business owners understand that revenue does not dictate your wealth, but profit does. And the higher the profit margins are in your business, the more money you will keep in your pockets as the owner.</p>
    <h2>To build wealth you need to have some fundamentals in place:</h2>
    <h3>1.    Money mindset is everything</h3>
    <p>You need to have a positive money mindset when it comes to creating wealth. Everyone carries a money story and it’s your job to understand what yours is and if it’s holding you back. Reframing your story to a millionaire’s mindset is essential for success because rich people think differently. How to get rich can’t be a passing phase in your life; it takes work and commitment.</p>
    <h3>2.    Millionaires still budget</h3>  
    <p>Hard to believe, but it’s true. Even millionaires follow a budget. The biggest secret on how to get rich and stay rich is spending less than you bring in. There will always be wants that exceed budget limits, even for millionaires, because there is not an unlimited supply of money.</p>  
    <h3>3.    Money management is key</h3>
    <p>Good money management is so important to get rich and stay rich. Money management is a behavior and habit. You need to be mindful of where you are investing and spending your money. There is a specific strategy to growing your wealth and maintaining it and you must follow it like you do a workout regime.</p>
    <h3>4.    Invest your money for growth</h3>
    <p>Investing in assets that will appreciate over time and provide you with a return on your investment such as dividend or interest payments is smart. The goal is to build your asset portfolio and make it so strong that you can live off the passive income in your retirement.</p>
    <h3>5.    Build your business around your personal financial goals</h3>
    <p>As a business owner you have more control over the money you make versus being an employee with a set salary. If you want more money in your pockets, you can increase your revenue and your profit margins to ensure you are taking home more money. The more profits you have in your business the more you can pay yourself a dividend or bonus, depending on the legal structure of your business.</p>
